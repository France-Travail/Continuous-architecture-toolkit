## Maintainers

Continuous architecture toolkit was initially developed by [Thierry Fraudet](mailto:34861241+tfraudet@users.noreply.github.com) & [Olivier Jauze](mailto:ojauze@gmail.com) from Michelin and by [Nicolas Chevalier](mailto:nch.nicolas.chevalier@gmail.com) from Gluendo to setup an agile architecture operating model and to support the Michelin digital journey.

They were quickly joined by a small group of enthusiasts from DXC, Société Générale and others sharing the same ideas about the evolution of architecture in the world of information system design and this project is now maintains by the following core group of people:
