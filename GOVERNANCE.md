# Governance

The objective of this document is to describe the process of decision making and defines the social rules of interaction for our project.

## Communication

If you'd like to speak to maintainers of this project, you can reach us through a bunch of different channels.

GitHub
On github.com, you can always notify the entire project team by using the @??? handle.

Slack
We're pretty active on #<creat a slack channel ?>.

## Roles and Responsibilities

* **Users** are community members who have a need for Continuous Architecture Toolkit. They are the most important members of the community and without them the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements. We asks  users to participate in community and give us as much feedback as they can. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users.

* **Contributors** are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. It could be anyone who identify requirements, report issue, add value to the project with a merged pull request, evangelising or help the community to grow. See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.

* **Maintainers** are people responsible over the direction of the project and are committed to improving it in the long run. There are the only people in a project with commit access (Maintainers are listed in the README.md file).

## Decision-Making process

Which model ?

* BDFL (“Benevolent Dictator for Life”)  
* Meritocracy: active project contributors (those who demonstrate “merit”) are given a formal decision making role. Decisions are  made based on pure voting consensus. The meritocracy concept was pioneered by the Apache Foundation
