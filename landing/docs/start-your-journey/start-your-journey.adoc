=== Start your journey

The deployment of the new ways of working (practices, rituals, framework) described in the Continuous Architecture Framework and Toolbox is a major change journey. There is no single pathway to move your enterprise (or part of it) from its current state to the ideal state (or north star) we recommend and which is embodied in the key tenets of the link:/docs/manifest/manifesto.html[Continuous Architecture Manifesto].

There are two ways of starting your journey:

* Bottom-up: deploy Continuous Architecture on a limited scope with a magnitude of change compatible with your existing organization's culture
* Top-down: design and deploy a more ambitious change journey which scope will a subset of your enterprise, for example one of its _Operating Unit_.
* Organic: combination of bottom-up and top-down

s
The bottom-up approach can help you _"test the water"_ and demonstrated success. At some point when your organization will ready for a more ambitious change agenda you will likely need to shift to a combination of bottom-up and top-down approach.

The diagram below which is described in the _Organization"_ view of the link:/docs/framework/framework.html[Continuous Architecture Framework], can help you define the scope and pace of your change journey.

==== Start journey Bottom-up 

The bottom-up approach is mostly at the team level and scopes one or a few agile teams. First you will start experimenting a few CA practices and rituals without changing the way teams are structured, for example documenting your architecture decisions using the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) template or assessing teams' autonomy. 

If your teams are structured along projects or functional skills you might discover they are not cross-functional and they are slowed-down by too many dependencies. At that point you might want to revisit the existing teams' topology and shift from them from a project structure and mindset to a product one as described in link:/docs/framework/organization.html[Organization].

When shifting to a truly agile organization, you might discover your teams are missing key skills, for example product owners or agile coach ones. To close we recommend investing first in re-skilling existing teams members and possibly hiring new talents.

During this transitions you might discover the existing reward system of your enterprise gets in the way of agile ways of working. For example teams may be get rewarded when the deliver outputs and not when customers experience outcomes.

At this stage a bottom-up approach may reach its limit. For example you might have to talk to management and HR to move the needle and evolve the existing reward system. It is time to initiate a more ambitious change journey.

You may consider deploying a management framework, for example link:https://www.kotterinc.com/8-steps-process-for-leading-change/[Kotter's 8-Step Process for Leading Change]. Since in a VUCA world classical top-down change management has limits and each enterprise is likely to conduct a change management journey that meets it specific needs describing a change management framework is out of the scope of Continuous Architecture.

Instead we will illustrate how Michelin has implemented a change journey that mix bottom-up and top-down in what we describe as an organic change approach. 

Last but not the least, we recommend you put in place some impact tracking system to document the benefits of your bottom-up approach. This will help build the case for a more ambitious change journey. At this stage you might be ready to add a top-down component to your change agenda.

==== Organic change approach: Michelin example

Three years ago, Michelin diagnosed that architecture could become n unbearable bottleneck and would not be able to sustain the digital acceleration. It was necessary to consider a structural change to better support the delivery team in their attempt to deliver value; at the same time, develop an operating model to maintain integrity at scale with empowered people, notably the architect community. 

The Continuous Architecture initiative was born: Michelin and Glue N'DO joined their forces in order to design and roll out an operating model to address Michelin architecture's main challenges. 
Let's describe the journey and on its main achievements:

* The last 3 years: From boosters to global organic deployment 
* The 5 Michelin's initial challenges 
* The Continuous operating model in a nutshell schema 
* The enablers: a shared vision; a guiding team; an open toolbox; an evolutionary model; a community and network 
* To conclude, organic change is about: "Thinking big and acting small"
