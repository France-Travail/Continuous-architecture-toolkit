A specific piece of work required to be done as a duty by a customer.
The job to be done is a context of experience in which products delivered by an enterprise aimed to provide beneficial outcomes in carrying out this work.
When products fit the need in the context of experience, they are said to be "hired" by the customer.

*When we buy a product, we essentially ‘hire’ something to get a job done. If it does the job well, when we are confronted with the same job, we hire that same product again. And if the product does a crummy job, we ‘fire’ it and look around for something else we might hire to solve the problem.*
