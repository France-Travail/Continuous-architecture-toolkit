For the launch of the web site, we need to define CA positioning, the targeted audience and the expected benefits

# Continuous architecture positioning

* There is a market space between so called agile framework (like Safe) & traditional architecture operating models (like Togaf). These are not agile at all and not opened. 
* That's why we created an open source architecture operating model to deal with agility (at the organization level) and combine architecture aspects into it

# For who?

* existing companies (more traditional) which have architecture practices or digital natives & startups that do architecture without having such practices (ie the architecture is done at the team level)
* Implicit architecture is definitively not a good strategy as said by Gregor Hohpe "implicit architecture means that no one is consciously performing the task of architecture. The result is often excessive complexity and reduced velocity, meaning the teams come to a grinding halt."
* Grady Booch is also regularly saying "it's not because you don't have architects that you won't end up with an architecture"

# Challenges we're trying to address

1. Close the gap between architects & teams to avoid the ivory tower syndrome. Make sure a dialog exists between the two.
2. Promote a continuous approach to enable pivots based on feedback and take decisions at the last responsible moment
3. Instill the product mindset into architecture activities. Make sure we design the architecture of a product knowing the eco-system it will evolve in.
4. Empower teams to make decisions instead of having a centralized decision making process
5. pending

# Benefits of using Continuous Architecture

Ease product mindset adoption, continuous dialog around the architecture, more team empowerments ...

# Our objectives

1. Federate a community around our practices and aligned with the agile enterprise as well as modern software engineering
2. Get some feedback to improve our operating model
3. Enrich our set of practices through contributions
# Deliverables

marketing launch text (FR & EN)

# Communication plan proposal
	
1. Everyone publish the news on its own social networks
2. List potential influencers that could relay our communication
    * DDD community: Cyrill Martraire, Mathias Verraes, Roméo
    * International: Gregor Hophe, Stefan Tilkov
    * Yves Caseau & CTO DXC Dan Huchon
3. Identify relays internally art Michelin & Société Générale so their employees could also communicate on CA
