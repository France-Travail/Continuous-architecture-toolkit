=== Glossary
//:toc: preamble

The glossary contains the definition of the key terms used in the Continuous Architecture Toolkit and Framework. Since a term may have more than one meaning depending on its usage context, more than one contextualized definition will be entered in the glossary.

The glossary is work in progress and is continuously updated.
