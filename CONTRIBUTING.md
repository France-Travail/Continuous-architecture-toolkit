# Rules/Principles

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document outlines how we expect contributions to happen.

Note that contributions can only be made by individuals representing themselves, not by a company.

## TL;DR

1. Start by searching the [issue tracker](./michelin/Continuous-Architecture-Toolkit/issues) to see if your contribution, be it a problem or a suggestion for an enhancement, was brought up before.
2. If nothing satisfying comes up, feel free to file a new issue. Provide as many details about your idea, problem, or suggestion as possible.
3. Once a conversation with one or more maintainers has taken place, it should become clear when it is appropriate to suggest a change (via, for example, a pull request).
4. Submit your change through Pull request. It will be reviewed and validated by maintainers using lazy consensus decision-making process.
