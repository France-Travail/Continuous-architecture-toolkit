        **Start from a simple question:** *what problems is the enterprise trying to solve?*. Question the way problems are framed. Look outside the frame and question the way the enterprise formulates its objectives. Before you dig into analyzing the enterprise problems make sure you are starting from a well formulated set of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).
