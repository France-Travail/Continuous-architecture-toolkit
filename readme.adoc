== Purpose

For Digital and Agile enterprises wanting to leverage the architecture
discipline to better steer their transformation journey while coping
with the exponential flow of changes, Continuous Architecture Toolkit
provides materials (posters, kits, roles description, rituals) to frame
the new way of doing architecture and accelerate the change management
among architects, delivery and operation teams.

== Gouvernance

See link:governance/governance.adoc#governance[Governance].

== How to contribute

We aim to make contributing to Continuous Architecture Toolkit a pleasant and enriching experience for all participants, and we welcome contributions of all kinds. Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills.

Check out our link:governance/governance.adoc#governance[Governance] for information on how to get involved.

=== Building the Continuous Architecture website on your machine

==== Asciidoctor and Jekyll

The https://continuous-architecture.org[Continuous Architecture landing page] is built with https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll], the content with https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor].
The website building is done with Docker image of Jekyll (in which the jekyll-asciidoc plugin is used as specified in the Gemfile) to avoid any specific environment trouble.
The website static HTML files are generated in the `dist` directory.

==== MacOS

* https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/[Install Docker Desktop]
* Run the `build.sh` script at the directory root with either "build" or "serve" parameter.
** `build` will generate the files in the dist directory
** `serve` will allow you to view the generated website in your browser http://0.0.0.0:4000[0.0.0.0:4000] as long as the container is running
* if you only want to generate html files from the asciidoc sources, you can use the `build-docs.sh` script

== Maintainers

Continuous architecture toolkit was initially developed by mailto:thierry.fraudet@michelin.com[Thierry Fraudet] & mailto:ojauze@gmail.com[Olivier Jauze] from Michelin and by mailto:nch.nicolas.chevalier@gmail.com[Nicolas Chevalier] from Gluendo to setup an agile architecture operating model and to support the
Michelin digital journey.

They were quickly joined by a group of enthusiasts from DXC, Société Générale and others, sharing the same ideas about the evolution of architecture in the world of information system design and this project is now maintained by the following core group of people:
