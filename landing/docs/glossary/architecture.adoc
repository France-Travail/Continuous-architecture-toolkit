[[product-architecture]]
===== Product Context

_Product Architecture_ is: (1) the arrangement of _functional elements_; (2) the mapping from functional elements to _physical components_; (3) the specification of the _interfaces_ among interacting physical components footnote:["The role of product architecture in the manufacturing firm" by  Karl Ulrich, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management, December 1993].

Perhaps the most important characteristic of a productâ€™s architecture is its <<modularity>>.

[[system-architecture]]
===== System Thinking Context

System architecture is the embodiment of concept, the allocation of physical/informational  function to the elements of form, and the definition of relationships among the elements  and with the surrounding context footnote:["System Architecture" by Cameron, Bruce, Crawley, Edward Selva and Daniel, Global Edition. Pearson Education Limited. ISBN 10: 1-292-11084-8].

[[software-architecture]]
